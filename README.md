The Bock is a promontory in the north-eastern corner of Luxembourg Cityâ€™s old historical district. The great river of Alzette surrounds its three sides offering a natural fortification. It was here that Count Siegfried built his Castle of Lucilinburhuc in 963, providing a basis for the development of the town which became Luxembourg.
